# Interpretation: Here is the density ridge plot, sorted by highest median review score (Morningside)
# to the lowest (Haymarket). As we can see, the review scores are quite close. The highest scoring 
# neighborhoods tend to have a "taller" distribution curve, implying a tighter spread of high review scores 
# compared to the bottom few.
